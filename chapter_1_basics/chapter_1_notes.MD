# Chapter 1 Notes

## Introduction to Python Basics 
- ### 1.1 Variables and Data Types: 
    - Variables store data so we can use and manipulate it later in a program. 
    - Think of a variable as a labeled container for a value

- ### Rules for Variables:
    1. Must starter with a letter or underscore (_).
    2. Can not start with a number
    3. Can only contain letters, numbers, or underscores
    4. Case-sensitive: Name != name (different variables)

- ### Common Data Types in Python:
    1. String(str): 
        - Text enclosed in quotes "nick" or 'nick' (name = 'nick')
    2. Integer (int):
        - Whole numbers (positive or negative) 23 -2 -19 (age = 23)
    3. Float(float):
        - Decimal numbers (positive or negative) -24.4 2.1 42.32 (height = 6.2)
    4. Boolean (bool):
        - Either True or False (is_trader = True)

- ### Using Variables in a Sentence:
    - You can combine variables with text using f-strings: 
    name = "nick"
    age = 23
    print(f"My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old)
