#Exercise 1: Declaring and Using Variables

"""Create a variable called name and assign it your name
"""

"""Create another variable age and assign it your age"""

"""Add a variable is_trader and set it to True"""

"""print a sentence that says: "Hi, my name is [name]. 
I am [age] years old, and it's [is_trader] that I am trader"""
"Use an f-string for this"

name = 'nick'
age = 23
is_trader = True

print(f"Hi, my name is {name}. I am {age} years old, and it's {is_trader} that I am a trader.")

"""Create three variables: shares (integer), price_per_share(float), and ticker (string, e.g., "NVDA")"""

"""Calculate the total cost of buying the shares and store it in a variable called total_cost"""

"""Print a sentence that shows the ticker, number of shares, and total cost"""
